Size of array: 6  
Elements:        [1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 4]
✅ Step-by-step Execution of pushZeroToEnd()
Method signature:

java
Copy code
public static void pushZeroToEnd(int[] arr)
We start with:

sql
Copy code
Initial array: [1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 4]
nonZero = 0
Now, we loop through the array with index i from 0 to 5.

🔁 i = 0
arr[0] = 1 → not zero ✅

Swap arr[0] with arr[nonZero] → swap(0, 0)

Array becomes: [1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 4] (no change)

nonZero = 1

🔁 i = 1
arr[1] = 0 → is zero ❌

Do nothing

nonZero stays = 1

🔁 i = 2
arr[2] = 2 → not zero ✅

Swap arr[2] with arr[nonZero] → swap(2, 1)

Array becomes: [1, 2, 0, 0, 3, 4]

nonZero = 2

🔁 i = 3
arr[3] = 0 → is zero ❌

Do nothing

nonZero = 2

🔁 i = 4
arr[4] = 3 → not zero ✅

Swap arr[4] with arr[nonZero] → swap(4, 2)

Array becomes: [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 4]

nonZero = 3

🔁 i = 5
arr[5] = 4 → not zero ✅

Swap arr[5] with arr[nonZero] → swap(5, 3)

Array becomes: [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0]

nonZero = 4
